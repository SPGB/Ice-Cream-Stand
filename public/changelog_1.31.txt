#PATCH 1.31

CORE
Adding trend voting - the more votes a flavour gets the more it will trend for (+$0.05 per vote) starting at $2.00 and maxing at $10.00
Trending flavours will be whatever flavour has the most votes, or a random flavour if all flavours have less than 10 votes
Added tooltips to the highscore buttons
Tooltips now only trigger when hovering over the icon, versus the entire row

AESTHETIC
Lightened the shop banner background
Optomized the logo image
Shortened the cherry stem in the logo
Money counter font size increased slightly
Increases the quest image size

BUG
Fixed an issue with the unread message title not going away
Fixed the truck tooltip showing Carts
Swears are now replaced with friendly motivational messages
